MORE INTO VIEWS AND VIEWPOINTS

RECALL VIEW AND VIEWPOINT
The use of Viewpoints and Views is an existing approach, that we have used
successfully, for dealing with complex architectural structures.
Both ideas are simple but have proved to be effective:
 Views are used to structure the architectural description into a number of pieces,
each describing one aspect of the system (the functional structure, the deployment
environment, the development constraints and so on). The architectural description is
made up of a set of views.
 Viewpoints provide templates for the views and as such a particular viewpoint is
used to develop each view. A viewpoint provides the architect with guidance by
defining what the corresponding view should or may contain, how to represent it, how
to go about developing it, potential problems to be aware of and their solution, and
so on.

The relationship between view and viewpoint is similar to that of object and class.
Using viewpoints and views helps to organise both the process being followed (the
viewpoints providing implcit structure and explicit guidance) and the artefacts produced
(the views being an organisation of the architectural description).

PIONEERS
The architectural viewpoints idea isn‘t all that new, having academic roots back in
the 1970s from David Parnas and more recently in the 1990s from Dewayne Perry
and Alex Wolf. Widespread awareness of viewpoints started to spread in the mid-
1990s and since then a number of sets of viewpoints have been developed.

IEEE Software in 1995, probably the earliest mainstream description.

SAMPLE SETS OF VIEWPOINTS
 Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) is an ISO
standard for describing distributed object systems and their viewpoint set
was published as part of the standard in 1995 too.

SAMPLE SETS OF VIEWPOINTS
• Christine Hofmeister, Rod Nord and Dilip Soni defined a set for real-
time and embedded systems while working at Siemens Research, based on
the way that Siemens software architects worked. Documented in their book
“Applied Software Architecture” in 1999.

… SAMPLE VIEWPOINTS
 Jeff Garland and Richard Anthony defined
a set of viewpoints for information systems,
using UML as the base description notation
across the views, documenting the set in their
book “Large Scale Software Architecture” in
2003.

… SAMPLE VIEWPOINTS
 Eoin Woods et al defined a set of viewpoints, based on the 4+1 set in the book
“Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and
Perspectives” in 2005. Conceptually, our set is like G & A’s, being practitioner focused, the
result of our own experience and aimed at information systems, although the set is a lot
smaller.

… SAMPLE VIEWPOINTS
 A Conceptual model for how viewpoints
and views relate to each other and their
environment (systems, architects, stakeholders
and so on) forms the basis of ISO Standard
42010 (which is a development of the
previous IEEE Standard 1471).
