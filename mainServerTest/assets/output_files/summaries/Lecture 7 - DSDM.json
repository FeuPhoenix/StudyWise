    "long": "- DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) is a leading framework for rapid application development in the UK.\n- Core principles of DSDM include focusing on business needs, delivering on time, collaborating, maintaining high quality, building incrementally, developing iteratively, continuous communication, and demonstrating control.\n- Disadvantages of DSDM include potential limitations on creativity and the need for structure and support.\n- DSDM typically follows five major phases: Feasibility, Business study, Functional model iteration, Design and build. - **Implementation Feasibility:**\n  - Review project specifications for achievability by your team\n  - Consider budget, timeline, and technology for goal attainment\n- **Business Study:**\n  - Research project from a business perspective\n  - Ensure alignment with organization objectives\n  - Evaluate competitiveness and user needs\n- **Functional Model Iteration:**\n  - Build prototype meeting specified requirements\n  - Test and evaluate prototype for functionalities\n- **Design and Build:**\n  - Refine prototype for efficiency\n  - Design additional components and address issues\n- **Implementation:**\n  - Release project into operational environment\n  - Obtain user feedback and make necessary adjustments\n\n- **Lifecycle Roles:**\n  - Business Sponsor, Business Visionary, Project Manager, Technical Coordinator, Business Analyst\n  - Technical Advisor, Business Advisor, Team Leader, Solution Developer, Solution Tester, Workshop Facilitator, DSDM Coach\n\n- **LEAN (Kanban):**\n  - LEAN: Development practices based on successful Lean methodologies in manufacturing\n  - Kanban: Method for managing knowledge work with just-in-time delivery\n  - Kanban emphasizes incremental, evolutionary process and systems change\n\n- **Principles of Kanban Board:**\n  - Start with current needs\n  - Pursue incremental change\n  - Respect roles and responsibilities\n  - Encourage leadership at all levels - Visualize the Workflow:\n  - Helps implement changes according to plan\n  - Uses card wall with columns to represent workflow states\n- Limit Work in Progress:\n  - Implement pull system for continuous changes\n  - Can be done using kanban system\n- Manage Flow:\n  - Monitor, measure, and report transitions between workflow states\n  - Evaluate changes\u2019 effects on the system\n- Make Process Policies Explicit:\n  - Necessary for rational, objective discussions on improvements\n- Feedback Loops:\n  - Encourages continuous, small changes that stick\n  - Teams track flow, quality, throughput, lead times for effectiveness\n- Improve Collaboratively:\n  - Achieve sustainable change through shared vision and understanding\n- Positive Side of Kanban:\n  - Everyone on the same page\n  - Reveals workflow bottlenecks\n  - Brings flexibility and responsiveness\n- Negative Side of Kanban:\n  - Outdated boards may lead to issues\n  - Boards may become overcomplicated\n  - Lack of timing associated with phases"
