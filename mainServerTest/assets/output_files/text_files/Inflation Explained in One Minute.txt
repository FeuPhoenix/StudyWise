Lets assume your monthly income were to somehow double. Congratulations. You can now, for the most part, afford to buy two times more stuff. But what if the monthly income of everyone else were to also double? Well, in that case youd no longer be able to buy two times more stuff because since everyone else also earns two times more, there would be two times more money chasing roughly the same number of goods. Lets take things one step further. What if your income doubles but the income of everyone else triples? In that case youd actually become poorer. Why? Because making two times more money is not enough to keep up with everyone else who now makes three times more. If theres an overall increase in the price of goods and services of x percent this year, you have to earn at least x percent more than last year to avoid becoming poorer. In real terms, history makes the effects of inflation crystal clear. Today, each dollar buys you approximately 39 times less potatoes than 100 years ago, or 20 times less coffee, 24 times less bread, and so on.
